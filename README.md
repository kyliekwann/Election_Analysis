# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:
With a collective dataset from Seth and Tom's election audit results, there were a collective amount of factors to the dataset that needed to be analyzes and interpretted. With the gradual lessons that had been taught in Module 3, the Election Challenge allowed for analyst to show their data analytics skills through determining the conclusions and analyzing theater outcomes and their comparison within the voter turnout between each county and candidate results. 

## Purpose
As analysts are able to solidfy their Python skills in Module 3, the election audit analysis challenge was a final representation of the built up skills and coding habits that were developed. By using the data results that came from Seth and Tom's election audit, analysts are able to help them analyze the voter turnout along with the presenting them with candidate voting results so that it could be sent out to the election commission. A separate electoral document is created which fully documents Python study, explains reasoning and the use of coding in terms of analyzing data for evaluating realistic scenarios.
